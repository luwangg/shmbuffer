Quick and dirty shared memory ring buffer

This was originally written to speed up OpenWebRX as an alternative to ncat
but now this should be useful for other purposes too.

Use:
shmwrite takes samples from stdin and writes them in a shared memory buffer.
shmread reads samples from there and writes them in stdout.

How it is actually used with OpenWebRX:
https://github.com/tejeez/openwebrx/commit/35836c84519244162a5dac373bf410509c933bdb


Why I wrote it:
1) I found the CPU use of ncat became significant when I wrote an experimental,
   faster DDC algorithm to use at high sampling rates.
2) Using a big enough memory buffer and some additional logic in OpenWebRX,
   it should be possible to allow listening to signals from a few seconds or
   a few minutes ago. (Would someone like to implement such a feature in
   OpenWebRX and its web UI?)
3) There seems to be bug in ncat.

This is just a quick hack indeed:
There's no real synchronization: when new data isn't available, shmread just
sleeps for 50 ms and checks again. This, however, seems to work well enough
and I don't really know how to do it better.
shmread doesn't check for buffer overflows, so something strange probably
happens if it's reading data too slowly.

Actually, shmwrite intentionally doesn't have any way to check whether all
shmread instances are ready to accept new data. In other words, shmwrite
never blocks. This makes the implementation simple but I also think it's
a better way to do in this application anyway, as buffer overflow is really
a sign of the system running out of CPU resources. Such a situation could be
handled simply by making shmread exit when it notices a buffer overflow,
effectively kicking random OpenWebRX users out when the server is overloaded.
I might try implement this if it seems necessary.
